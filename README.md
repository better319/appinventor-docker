# App Inventor Dockerized

This repository contains a ready-to-use Dockerfile to help you build an [AppInventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu) docker image you can run locally.

It is based on the Vagrant build process of the official [appinventor-sources](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources) repository. It will download that code and its dependencies during the build.

## Building / Running

- Run `docker-compose up` (it will take 5-10 minutes for the first build)
- Access it with <http://localhost:8888>
- Login "with Google" and `test@example.com`


## TODO

[] Persistence?
